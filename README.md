# purpose
I was tired of using gpt to generate starter apps with some basic styling that I liked, so I am posting this project to github to serve as a minimal template.

# setup

install your python interpreter <br>
install the flask library: pip3 install -r requirements.txt <br>
run the app: python3 app.py <br>
